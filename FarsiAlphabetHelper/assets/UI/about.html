			Farsi (Persian) alphabet has 32 letters. 28 letters  are exactly as Arabic alphabet, however, 
			in Farsi  most of these letters pronounce differently.
			The extra four letters in Farsi are ,پ, چ, ژ, گ. For example in  Arabic there is no sound such as 
			"pe". In Arabic "pe" (پ) is normally replaced by "fe" or "be".
			 It is interesting to know that language Farsi, was actually always pronounced Parsi.

			The letters, ت ,  ط  are pronounce the same in Farsi (te), while in Arabic it has a different 
			pronunciation. The letters ,ز, ذ, ظ, ض are also pronounce the same (ze), unlike Arabic.
			So you might wonder why Farsi speakers need so much ze? Well, Normally in pure Farsi words,
			you do not see letters such as: ط,ظ, ض. So probably Farsi speakers  need these letters  because
			there are lots of Arabic words, that have squeezed in their language.

		   In both Arabic and Farsi, there are no letters consider as  vowels.  Instead, for beginners 
		   (only in children books) some sounds are placed on or under the letters to make them readable.
		   So how can you tell if it is pronounced "ba", "be" or "bo"? Well practice, you should learn 
		   the words by heart.
